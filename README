find-repeated-words
===================

Website: https://github.com/jdscheff/find-repeated-words.py
Author:  Jeremy Scheff <jdscheff@gmail.com>

This simple Python script takes a text file as input and outputs an HTML file
with words that are repeatedly used close together highlighted.

Usage
-----

./find-repeated-words.py input.txt

./find-repeated-words.py input.txt output.html

If only an input file is given, then output will be saved with the same name
but .html. So the first example will save the output as input.html, and the
second example will save it as output.html.
